# Time-Series Message
In addition to be registered in the AS event-entity graph the event updates a time series with this datapoint.
Please note: For high frequency, fixed interval, time-series we recommend using the DataPoint message rather than sending in regular events with the ts_data aspect.
Additional dimensions are added from Locale, Client Device and GeoLocation. Additional/manual dimensions can be set using the Classification aspect.
