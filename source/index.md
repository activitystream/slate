# Introduction
Here you will find the documentation for the Activity Stream platform.</br>
We hope it will help you get quickly up-to-speed and provide you with enough information to tak full advantage of our platform.

##[Activity Stream API](/as-api.html)
Everything you need to know about sending event-messages, time-series data and other activity stream items to AS via REST API or via Message Queue. It also covers how to query the activity stream, deal with access controls and several other advanced topics when it comes to manipulating the activity stream.

##[Provisioning API](/provisioning.html)
Here you learn how to configure the Activity Stream platform to suit your needs, how to create new users, create scoped API keys (for specific use-cases) and more. [more](/provisioning.html) (pending)

<!--
##Graph Queries (SQL)
The Historical store, containing all the activity stream data in it's event-entity graph, can be queried using a SQL like language which has been enhanced to facilitate graph traversals and other graph specific goodies. [more](/graph.html) (pending)
-->

##[Analytic Queries](/analytics.html)
The Real-Time Analytics store is always up-to-date (more like up-to-the-second) and is capable of answering ad-hoc queries in an instance. Here you learn how to use the simple REST queries as well as to use advanced querying. [more](/analytics.html) (pending)

<!--
##The AS Event-Type Catalog*
Activity Stream is building a catalog of predefined actions. When these actions are used the Observation Engine automatically kicks in and starts producing Observations without any further configuration and tailored dashboards as well as domain specific reports become available.  [more](/as-library.html)

\***Please Note:** It may depend on your subscription what observations, dashboards and reports become available to you.

##Recipes
Here we collect all the tips, tricks and recipes for known/common scenarios. This section is maintained in collaboration with our users. [more](/recipes.html) (Pending)

##Details & references
More detailed reading material available for those interested in nuts and bolts. The common denominator here is that this is material that we did nat want to have clutter our API documentation but we hope some may find interesting or at least helpful. [more](/details.html)
